            <p id="about">Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India.Born on
                february 19, 1630 he is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of his time.

                With his determination and great administrative skills, Shivaji carved out an empire out of the
                declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which eventually became the great Maratha Empire.
                Shivaji Maharaj fought strongly against the Mughals to form the Maratha Kingdom.
                At the early age, he learned military training and how to fight in the guerrilla war. His dream of
                forming the Marathi Kingdom forced to began conquering neighboring territories. At the very age of
                nineteen, he captured the forts of Torna, Chakan, Singhagarh, and Purandar.
                In 1674 he proclaimed himself an independent sovereign. He forged an alliance with the sultans in the
                south, thereby blocking the spread of Mughal rule.
                Shivaji died at the age of 50 on April 3, 1680, at the Raigad Fort, after suffering from a bout of
                dysentery.
